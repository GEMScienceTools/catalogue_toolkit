The Catalogue Toolkit is an open-source set of Python tools for the compilation
and harmonisation of earthquake catalogues.

Within the toolkit it is possible to do the following:

* Read/Write Earthquake Catalogues from common format (ISC (ISF), GCMT, csv)
* Search for duplicate events from multiple catalogues
* Using Pandas, query database for events reported in common magnitude scales
* Apply orthogonal regression techniques to compare magnitude scales within
  a database
* Homogenise a catalogue into a common magnitude scale by applying
  a user-defined hierarchy of conversion models
